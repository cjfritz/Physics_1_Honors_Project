# Physics_1_Honors_Project
This is a computer application that solves two-dimensional kinematics problems and provides graphical comparisons between position, velocity, and acceleration parameters with respect to time.  This project was completed for a University Physics 1 Honor Project.

The KinOMatic.jar file is an executable of the program, KinOMatic.java is the source code, and the remaining files are associated with JFreeChart, a free third-party library used to provide graphing functions for this application.
